# Frequency_Mode_Median
Write a C# program that displays a frequency histogram. Your program's inputs are the array size and a random seed. Your program should calculate the data frequency array . From the frequency array, your program should display the frequency histogram.  Also, you should calculate the mean, median, and mode of a set of integer numbers. The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers (i.e., the average). The median is the number that sits in the middle of the data set (if there is an even number of data points, it is the average of the two middle values). The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the data set. Hint: Sort the array first before calculating the median.
